# Predicting-rain
This project is based on the weather dataset available in Kaggle. It involved data cleaning and preprocessing , data transformation and creation of feature vectors. Then the machine learning classification techniques such as decision tree, random forest, logistic regression and GBT classifier methods within the spark API are applied on the data to find probability of rain.
